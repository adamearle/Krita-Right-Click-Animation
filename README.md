# Krita-Right-Click-Animation
Krita's right-click animation menu for full-screen animation and sketching & Docker buttons, (The ideal is "Docker Buttons" can be dragged anywhere on the screen for an artist to quickly open commonly used window docks.
The functionality here is designed around working on a single touch screen with no keyboard to help animators work a lot faster since milage is so important
